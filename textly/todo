** JS to blocks! **
JS -> AST -> JSON -> XML -> Blocks
    Or 
JS -> AST -> JSON -> Blocks


CodeMirror Approach:
 - add Turtle commands to the language


Seamless Field Approach:
 - make JS area updateable and have it re-prettify on key strokes
 - make JS edits update blocks
 	 - this probably happens via JS -> xml -> blocks


Low:
 - moved the html inside the block div into its init function (to make for easier plug-and-play)
 - explore code mirror -> is that a dependancy that is worth introducing?

Other Ideas:
 - think about a feature where clicking a block highlights the asscoiated lines of text
